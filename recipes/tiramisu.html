        <p>Picture a decadent symphony of textures. Delicate sponge fingers, softened by a whisper of strong coffee, nestle against a velvety symphony of creamy bliss. A touch of bittersweet dust dances playfully on top, like moonlight on snow. This, my friend, is the essence of tiramisu: a poem of indulgence sung in every bite.

        <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian coffee-flavored dessert. It is made with layers of ladyfingers soaked in espresso, mascarpone cheese filling, and cocoa powder. The ladyfingers are dipped in the espresso mixture and then arranged in a dish. The mascarpone cheese filling is made with eggs, sugar, mascarpone cheese, and heavy cream. It is spread over the ladyfingers, and then the dessert is dusted with cocoa powder.</p>
